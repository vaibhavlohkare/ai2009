How to join the ai2009 project in your Eclipse

= Details =

1) Install svn plug-in to Eclipse, like "tigris.subversion", which I am using.

2) Open Eclipse, and specify any WorkSpace

3) *New* a project

4) *Select* "SVN: checkout projects from SVN", then *Click* "Next"

5) *Select* Create a new repository location, then *Click* "Next"

6) The Url is "http://ai2009.googlecode.com/svn/trunk". (Check it from the "Source" tab above)

7) *Accept* the license

8) Put in your user name and password, which are used to access the source code on Google. (Find them out from the *Source* tab above)

9) It will pop up a window with projects you can join. Pick up "ai2009", and Eclipse will setup the new project for you.

10) Try to add or modify files, and submit codes with SVN commands

If you need a SVN shell on Windows, download TortoiseSVN-1.6.6.17493-win32-svn-1.6.6.msi
